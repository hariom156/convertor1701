<h3>Centimeter:</h3><p><b>The centimetre, abbreviated as "cm," is a unit of length in the metric system, which is widely used across the world today. Its history dates back to the late 18th century when the metric system was first introduced in France during the French Revolution. The metric system aimed to provide a universal and decimal-based system of measurement. The centimetre is defined as one-hundredth of a meter, making it a convenient and precise unit for everyday measurements.
 It is extensively used in science, engineering, and daily life for measuring short distances, such as the length of a pencil or the width of a book, offering a versatile and easily understood unit of measurement.
